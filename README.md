# Hello World

I am a software engineer learning how to better use the tools provided to me in order to achieve my life goals, today that is github.

I made a simple 1 line hello world program in python to show you that I am a true master with technology...

The true reason is that I feel it is a requirement for all programmers to do so but mostly it is a simple way to learn how to share my achievments on github

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
